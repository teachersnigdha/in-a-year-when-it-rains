```
When it rains, it rains,
Surface water, overflowing shores,
King of Manduk, on the banks of the Mandvi,
Sing, sing and dance slowly.

Queen Nalini, shaking her head,
Called honey, swollen,
When it rains, it rains,
Juicy water, swollen shore.

Tiki Meen T, says Ka Kane,
Come on, let's jump,
The brother of the fisherman, rejoicing,
The net took it, the scorpion burned.

When it rains, it rains,
Fresh water, on the shore,
Dove pigeons, sitting and selling,
Next to the dove, he sees the palace.

Learn to dance cake, rock,
Tailoring, looking at Nav,
Brother Dhintika, shaking his head,
To the weak, take the hug.

Gayal's, musical voice,
Vashi Asin, Kare Bivor,
Bug Baguli's, Dankada Dance,
Seeing the crab, it is shocking.

Bai is hanging, in the lap of Basar,
In the heat of the moment, the wind blows,
When it rains, it rains,
Juicy water, rising to the shore.
