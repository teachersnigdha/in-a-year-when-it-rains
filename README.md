```
In a year, when it rains,
Pond's water, is overflowing its shores,
King of the frogs, on the banks of the Mandvi,
Singing, ringing, and dancing slowly.

Queen Lotus, shaking her head,
Honeybees call, with swollen pride,
In a year, when it rains,
Pond's water, is overflowing its shores.

Small fish, whisper in ears,
Come on, let's jump together,
The fisherman brother, rejoices,
Taking his net, across the water.

In a year, when it rains,
Pond's water, is overflowing its shores,
Hen on a branch, sits anxiously,
Beside the dove, watching the clouds.

Dances a peacock, on a rock,
Spreading its tail, looks at the sky,
Grasshopper brother, shaking his moustache,
With doob grass, around his arms.

A shephard's, musical voice,
Comes floating, making me mad,
Male and female cranes', bamboo dance,
Crab watches, it in surprise.

Weaver bird hanging, in the lap of nest,
In a windy storm, on a pine tree's branch,
In a year, when it rains,
Pond's water, is overflowing its shores.
